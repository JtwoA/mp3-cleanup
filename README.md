# mp3-cleanup
This script creates a folder based upon filename up to hyphen (example, "artist - song title") and moves matching files to that folder.  Source files must be named in the "artist - song title" format and be of .mp3 file extension.

Deliver this file to the source folder and run.  Sub-folders should be created named for the artist and all songs matching that artist name will be delivered to said sub-folder.
